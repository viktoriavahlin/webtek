        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is imaginary and called "Organisasjonen for nye studenter i Trondheim // Inkluderingsbanden". 
            This Organisation works to improve everyday-life for both new and old students in Trondheim. 
            They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a great way to do this. 
            They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to help new students in Trondheim to get to know the city and have a smooth start as students here. 
            It will give an overview over all the different things you can do and all you need to know as a new student. 
            The goal is that they become integrated faster and easier. 
            This includes giving tips on how to easily find good routines in your everyday life, as it shows you how to get around and where you should be. 
            Furthermore, it wants to socialize the students as it is meant as a guide for students looking for new activities. 
            This includes sport activities and voluntary activities. 
            As the page describes what you do in the different organizations, new students can meet equal minded people and create new friendships by using this page. 
            The goal is also to preserve the great student-culture for future students. 
            Therefore, the most important student traditions will be described on this page. 
            This includes events, student songs, etc.</p>

        <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
            <p></p>

        <h3>Page layout and appearance</h3>
        <p>“A description of design decisions that are universal to your site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page and its appearance, banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable). In addition to the textual description of these elements, you should include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common elements and no other content. Finally, you should describe how these universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its audience.”</p>

            <p>The design choices are made with a focus of visibility, with a clean and aesthetic view and with a focus that it should be easy to navigate. We will use the same look though the whole page to make it look pulled together and carried out. </p>
            
            <p>For the font, Times New Roman will be used through the webpage. The titles will be in size in 30, the subtitles will be in 25 and the text will be in 25. The color scheme we have chosen is a yellow-green combination to resemble the colors of NTNUI. The background will have the green color and the navigation bar will be yellow. The text will be black. The navigation bar will be positioned at the top of the page at all times. This way, it is alway easy accessible and you can always navigate to another page. We will have a footer at the bottom of all pages. This will include information about the creators and the organization of the page. It will have the contact information, such as e-mail of the company, such that the people visiting the page can get in contact with the creator for feedback or questions.</p>
            
            <p>We think these choices will fulfill the goals of the webpage. As we aim towards students looking for information on studying in Trondheim, the information must be easy accessible. This is why the page must be clear, and easy to navigate through. The navigation bar at the top will give the student the ability to get an efficient overview over the page by just checking what each page consists of. Furthermore, by adding a footing with contact information enables the students to reach out if they have questions. We believe these choices will make it easier to integrate new students in the Trondheim-culture.</p>

        <h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
        <p>To meet the minimum requirement for Javascript applications, the following functions will be implemented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop down menu, to be able to clearly and easily see all the pages that are available to you. Javascript-function for when the mouse cursor hovers over the menu bar, further subcategories will appear. For example, the category transportation will have the subcategories “Within Trondheim” with further subcategories “Bus”, “Bicycle” and “e-scooter”. There will also be “How to get to Trondheim” with the categories “Plane”, “Train” and “Bus”. All these subcategories will be shown in the drop down menu when the corresponding main category is hovered over by the mouse cursor.
                drop_down.js</li>
            <li>Rotational album of pictures of student life in Trondheim. There will be a Javascript function for randomly displaying pictures of typical student activities in Trondheim. This is to quickly and easily familiarize the user with things students in Trondheim usually do. There will be a database of pictures to choose from, the user might get bored if there is too little variation.
                pic_album.js</li>
            <li>Translate. There will be a Javascript-function to translate the page to English. The page is written in Norwegian to make it easy for the authors of the page. The webpage is also supposed to be welcoming to international students, therefore a translation function will be implemented. To translate the page, there will be a button on the top right of the menu bar with the British flag and the text “English”. This is to make it clear how to translate. When the page is translated to English, the button will display the Norwegian flag and the text “Norwegian”.
                translate.js</li>
            <li>Contact form. There will be a Javascript-function that controls the contact form. There will be fields to fill in: name, e-mail address, phone-number, subject and the inquiry. When the contact form is submitted, the site will display a message to the user, such as “Inquiry submitted successfully”. The contact form will be sent as an email to the web page managers.
                cont_form.js</li>
