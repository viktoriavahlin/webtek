            They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a great way to do this. 
            They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>

        <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
            <p>The navigation structure of our website is not very complicated. From the homepage you can navigate to four different main pages (together with information about us and contact), which all have subsections one can navigate further into. There are no connections between the subsections of different main sections.
                Our website has a global navigation, with the header menu being the same for all pages.
                The sitemap of our website is:

                <p>This structure is intuitive to use.</p>
                

        <h3>Page layout and appearance</h3>
            <p>The design choices are made with a focus of visibility, with a clean and aesthetic view and with a focus that it should be easy to navigate. We will use the same look though the whole page to make it look pulled together and carried out. </p>
            <p>For the font, Times New Roman will be used through the webpage. The titles will be in size in 30, the subtitles will be in 25 and the text will be in 25. The color scheme we have chosen is a yellow-green combination to resemble the colors of NTNUI. The background will have the green color and the navigation bar will be yellow. The text will be black. The navigation bar will be positioned at the top of the page at all times. This way, it is alway easy accessible and you can always navigate to another page. We will have a footer at the bottom of all pages. This will include information about the creators and the organization of the page. It will have the contact information, such as e-mail of the company, such that the people visiting the page can get in contact with the creator for feedback or questions.</p>
            <p>We think these choices will fulfill the goals of the webpage. As we aim towards students looking for information on studying in Trondheim, the information must be easy accessible. This is why the page must be clear, and easy to navigate through. The navigation bar at the top will give the student the ability to get an efficient overview over the page by just checking what each page consists of. Furthermore, by adding a footing with contact information enables the students to reach out if they have questions. We believe these choices will make it easier to integrate new students in the Trondheim-culture.</p>
            
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>In this section we will give descriptions of the content of each page in our website together with a mockup of it. </p>
