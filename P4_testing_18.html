        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is imaginary and called "Organisasjonen for nye studenter i Trondheim // Inkluderingsbanden". 
            This Organisation works to improve everyday-life for both new and old students in Trondheim. 
            They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a great way to do this. 
            They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>
