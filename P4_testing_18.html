        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is imaginary and called "Organisasjonen for nye studenter i Trondheim // Inkluderingsbanden". 
            This Organisation works to improve everyday-life for both new and old students in Trondheim. 
            They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a great way to do this. 
            They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>

        <h3>Testing Documents</h3>
        <p>First we asked people to tell us more about themself and what they were using to test the website. Then we asked what they thought about the visual of the page. 
            Following we asked if everything on the page worked and if it was easy to find and lastly we asked about the functionality of the javascript code. 
            Everyone was asked to use the website while they answered the forms.
