        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is imaginary and called "Organisasjonen for nye studenter i Trondheim // Inkluderingsbanden". 
            This Organisation works to improve everyday-life for both new and old students in Trondheim. 
            They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a great way to do this. 
            They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>

        <h3>Testing Documents</h3>
        <p>First we asked people to tell us more about themself and what they were using to test the website. Then we asked what they thought about the visual of the page. 
            Following we asked if everything on the page worked and if it was easy to find and lastly we asked about the functionality of the javascript code. 
            Everyone was asked to use the website while they answered the forms. 
            <br><b>The google form:</b>
            <a href="//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf75B6y8Jhagns6GJYiadembD6Nz3S34AwXcCyilaYYGPBZcA/viewform">Google forms</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Intended audience:</b>
            Out intended audience is new and old students that might not be very familiar with Trondheim and its student traditions.

        <h3>Feedback Summary</h3>

        <b>Feedback on the design:</b> The people we tested on did not agree on the design. Some of them liked the design and the colors, others were not fans of the color combination, stating they were old fashioned. One person was a particular fan of the banner, and one liked our logo. We also got some feedback on the formatting. The font and the photos were said to be too small for some, and one said that the formatting was weird in the text-boxes. On the page “contact us” we got feedback that the position of the text was “wack”, and that the text should disappear after one sends the form.
        <br><b>Feeback on the navigation:</b> Most users found the page easy to navigate. More than 50% (52.6%) of the users said it was very easy to navigate, and no one rated it below a ⅗. The users struggled a bit with finding the “about us” page, and we got feedback that there should maybe be a link in the dropdown menu for this and the “contact us” page.
        The users found the navigation bar and dropdown menu relatively easy to use. One of the testers struggled a bit with the cursor getting beyond the dropdown menu and disappearing. Another person did not get the dropdown menu to work on their phone, but it worked on their computer. There was also some difficulty with the link to the traditions-page, as this was sometimes covered by the logo. Several people also gave feedback that it was difficult to use the dropdown menu to navigate to the subpages. This was because they did not lead to the start of the subpages, but rather the middle of them. That means one has to scroll a bit up to get to the start of the subpage. We also got feedback that the links references on the “activities” did not work.
        
        <br><b>Feedback on the usability:</b> For the usability, it seemed as the testers found it easy to use. However, people found that some things could have been better. One test person would have preferred it if it was possible to scroll through photos on the homepage and not just click. But we also got feedback that it was very nice. In addition, it would have been nice if the page linked to the organizations that the page describes, such as sit.no, uka.no etc. The map was also critiqued as it would be nice if it was interactive such that they can zoom and navigate on the page.

        <h3>Your Response</h3>
        <p>The problem with the dropdown menu leading to a bit past the selected part is absolutely something that should have been addressed. Instead of this behavior it should direct the user to the subsection header.
In “Activities” the provided links should have been clickable, and this should be easy to address. Also the page should have more links and references to sites such as uka.no, samfundet.no and so on.
Choice of colors are subjective and the mixed reactions are to be expected. The reactions were more on the positive side than negative, and we are happy with this. The colors will not be changed.
A self made interactive map would be very impressive and useful, but maybe outside the scope of this website. Another possibility would be to integrate Google Maps which is a very powerful tool. 
The “about us” part is only linked to in the footer, but could be linked to in the dropdown menu as well. This would mess with the nice symmetrical layout of the header, but would be easier to navigate.

        <h3>Self-reflection</h3>
        <p>This project has been a really nice experience for the group members. We have worked really well together, and have not had any problems within the group. We all feel that the project has given us a better understanding of how you can create a webpage from scratch, and has taught us a lot of new things within HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has also given us valuable experience within product development and agile development, as we have worked in weekly sprints with different goals. We have also used a SCRUM-board for each sprint to visualize and concretize our goals. As we have created our webpage using a Github repository, we have also gotten valuable experience using git, which was new for some of the group members. As we have a lot of different backgrounds within the group, we have also learnt a lot of different things from each other. All in all it has been a great learning experience for us all.
