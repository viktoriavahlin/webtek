        To meet the minimum requirement for Javascript applications, the following functions will be implemented:
    </body>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Drop down menu</b>, to be able to clearly and easily see all the pages that are available to you. 
            <b>Javascript</b>-function for when the mouse cursor hovers over the menu bar, further subcategories will appear. 
            For example, the category transportation will have the subcategories “Within Trondheim” with further subcategories 
            “Bus”, “Bicycle” and “e-scooter”. There will also be “How to get to Trondheim” with the categories “Plane”, “Train” and 
            “Bus”. All these subcategories will be shown in the drop down menu when the corresponding main category is hovered over 
            by the mouse cursor.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Rotational album of pictures of student life in Trondheim.</b> There will be a <b>Javascript</b>-function for randomly 
            displaying pictures of typical student activities in Trondheim. This is to quickly and easily familiarize the 
            user with things students in Trondheim usually do. There will be a database of pictures to choose from, the user 
            might get bored if there is too little variation.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Translate.</b> There will be a <b>Javascript</b>-function to translate the page to English. The page is written in Norwegian to make 
            it easy for the authors of the page. The webpage is also supposed to be welcoming to international students, therefore a 
            translation function will be implemented. To translate the page, there will be a button on the top right of the menu bar 
            with the British flag and the text “English”. This is to make it clear how to translate. When the page is translated to 
            English, the button will display the Norwegian flag and the text “Norwegian”.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Contact form.</b> There will be a <b>Javascript</b>-function that controls the contact form. There will be fields to fill in: 
            name, e-mail address, phone-number, subject and the inquiry. When the contact form is submitted, the site will display 
            a message to the user, such as “Inquiry submitted successfully”. The contact form will be sent as an email to the web 
            page managers.
