    <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
    <p>Our client is imaginary and called "Organisasjonen for nye studenter i Trondheim // Inkluderingsbanden".
        This Organisation works to improve everyday-life for both new and old students in Trondheim.
        They feel that a website where all student activities and opportunities in the city are presented would be a
        great way to do this.
        They also want to include practical information about Trondheim.</p>

    <h3>The link to our page</h3>
    <p>https://folk.ntnu.no/hannafna/Webtek/homepage.html</p>

    <h3>The changes we have made</h3>
    <p>We have not made a lot of changes, but the changes we made are below.</p>
    <b>Changes to the pictures:</b> Some of the pictures have been changes from the inital pictures we presented.
    <br><b>Changes to the translate button:</b> In the initial pictures its a button called "english", but now its a
    button that says "oversett" and it can translate to more than one language. It was easier to import this google
    function then making it only for english.
    <br>
    <b>
        Changes to the content in traditions
    </b>
        Wrote some more content as it felt a bit thin. Also added some pictures to the sections to better vizualize
        student activites in Trondheim.
    <br>
    <b>Changes to the CSS styling:</b>
    <li>All the subheaders have been centered</li>
    <li>Changed the sizes of the title to "xx-large" (32px) og subtitles "x-large" (24px) and the text is 14px.</li>
    <br>
    <p>Other then this have we not changed a lot from what we inital presented.</p>

    <h3>How each of the team members fulfilled their minimum requirements.</h3>
    <p>Tone fulfilled her HTML requirements with finishing her code for the information about volunteerwork page.
        Marit fulfilled her HTML requirements with finishing her cofe for the information about activities page.
        Then Tone and Marit fulfilled their JacaScript requirements by making the drop down menu we use on all the
        pages.
        Hanna fufilled her JavaScript and HTML requirements by finishing the homepage html and making the picture album
        javascript that is shown on the front page.
        Viktoria fufilled her JavaScript and HTML requirement by finishing the transportation page and making the
        JavaScript for the contact form
        Hallvard finished his requirement by finishing the page about traditions and making the footer JavaScript for
        all the pages.
        Alexandra fufilled her JavaScript and HTML requirement by finishing the contact and about us page, and making
        the translation JavaScript button.
        Everyone then did a final control by going over the pages to look for mistakes and then Hanna validated all the
        pages.</p>
